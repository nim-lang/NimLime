Settings
--------

See Preferences -> PackageSettings -> NimLime

Autocompletion works per default in an on-demand mode.
This means <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> has to be pressed again to fetch Nim compiler completions.
It can also be set into an immediate mode.

If auto-completions don't work copy the `nim_update_completions` block from the NimLime
default key bindings file to the user key bindings file.

Checking the current file automatically on-save can be enabled through the setting `check.on_save.enabled`.

The path to the compiler can be configured through the setting `nim.executable`.
Per default it is set to `nim`, which means that the compiler must be in your `PATH` for the plugin to work.


Contributing
------------

Pull requests are welcome! See DEVELOPMENT.md for an overview of NimLime's design.

Clone the repository in your Sublime package directory.

Install the [PackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/PackageDev).

Modify the `.YAML-tmLanguage` files and regenerate the `.tmLanguage` files
by summoning the command palette and selecting the `Convert (YAML, JSON, PLIST) to...`
command. Don't modify the `.tmLanguage` files, they will be overwritten!
